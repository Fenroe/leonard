# Leonard

Leonard is a discord bot that schedules reminders for events. Users can set reminders using the website or bot commands. Reminders can be one-off or weekly, and weekly reminders support one-time cancellations or hiatuses in an elegant way. 

This project will consist of a frontend website, a backend REST API, and a discord bot written in Javascript.
